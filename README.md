# U.S.-Flights-Data-Analysis-Power-BI


Project Overview
This repository presents an in-depth analysis of airline and airport operations for US flights in 2015, based on data sourced from Kaggle. The project encompasses a full lifecycle of data handling from extraction through visualization, focusing on 5,000,000+ commercial airline flights records.

Process Details :
Data Extraction 🔄:

Utilized a Python script to automatically extract data, ensuring the ability to refresh data for up-to-date analysis. The script manages extensive datasets involving flight operations. 🐍
Data Transformation and Cleaning ✨:

Applied rigorous cleaning processes to enhance data quality by addressing missing values and duplicates.
Transformed data for analysis suitability, adjusting timestamps, and categorizing reasons for cancellations.
Data Loading 📥:

Efficiently loaded the prepared data into an analytics database, facilitating comprehensive analysis.
Data Modeling 📊:

Created a star schema to facilitate effective querying and data aggregation necessary for the analysis.
Data Analysis 🔍:

Analyzed 5.82 million rows across 40 fields to determine flight volume variations, departure delay percentages and durations, causes of cancellations, and airline reliability.
Reporting and Visualization 📈:

Developed intuitive dashboards and visual representations, using bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to clearly illustrate trends and outliers in flight operations.
